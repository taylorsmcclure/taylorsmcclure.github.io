# Why am I here?

This is a personal blog based on [Jeykll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/){:target="_blank"} and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}

I mainly spew information that is not relevant to most people, but hey this is an outlet? Right? That's healthy?

My posts will be conversational with a mix of cynicism and sarcasm, so I apologize in advance. Most posts will fall under two main categories "Lifestyle" and "Tech."

For lifestyle posts you can expect my opinions or experiences with products for the "nerd" demographic, or just things I feel like talking about in my life.

Tech posts will mostly relate to what I am involved with at work or some of the projects I am currently working on. I know you are so excited to see this, no please you need to contain yourself.

This theme is very creative and I am not. So obviously I forked it from [taylantali](http://taylantatli.me/Halve/halve-theme/){:target="_blank"}. Check them out, they are very talented.

### Ketogenic Diet

So let's start this off explaining what a ketogenic diet is. Verbatim from the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet){:target="_blank"}:

> The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet that in medicine is used primarily to treat difficult-to-control (refractory) epilepsy in children. The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates. Normally, the carbohydrates contained in food are converted into glucose, which is then transported around the body and is particularly important in fueling brain-function. However, if there is very little carbohydrate in the diet, the liver converts fat into fatty acids and ketone bodies.

While this diet was primarilly designed to help children with epilepsy additional independent research proves it is actually a beneficial diet for body fat loss. A great resource albiet not so peer-reviewed is the [/r/keto](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/keto_in_a_nutshell){:target="_blank"} subreddit. So let's take a look at their summary on the application of the keto diet for weight loss:

> Ketosis, to put it simply, is the state in which you burn fat for fuel. The human body isn’t stupid, it will burn what it has in most abundance that yields the most energy for its volume. Carbs (some) burn up quick but are packed with INTENSE fuel that yield large bursts of energy. Compare this to an energy drink that a lot of modern culture seems to adore. Fat and protein burn slowly and allow a steady stream of energy; your energy levels won’t soon crash because your body can’t get rid of it near as fast as carbohydrates.

> Ketosis also helps regulate your blood without complications. Involving complex carbs into your diet causes your body to heighten your blood sugar and as a result produce insulin. This stuff is nasty in large amounts; consider it to be your blood’s very own personal, fat-kicking police force. High blood sugar is interpreted as TOXIC by your body, so the insulin regulates your blood to cleanse it. Soon, though, your body starts struggling to keep up; when you take high amounts of carbs (sugar) and the insulin cant keep up....your body converts sugar to fat and insulin stores it in cells. Your body is capable of regulating your blood sugar on its own without help when you aren’t mainlining so much sucrose. Ketogenic diets avoid such problems!

Now you may be thinking, wow this sounds amazing. Why are not more people doing this?! Well there are some adverse effects reported by the medical community. I'd like the reference [dietdoctor.com](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb){:target="_blank"} for this even though it appears to be not peer-review much like my reddit source.

##### Adverse Effects of a Ketogenic Diet or Low Carb, High Fat (LCHF) Diet

There are also some less frequent issues of the ketogenic diet such as less alcohol tolerance, elevated cholesterol, gallstone problems, breast feeding issues, and gallstone problems.

The main reason I like the sketchily named dietdoctor.com site is they also give ways to combat these side effects. Most of these remedies include drinking adequate amounts of water and supplementing your sodium intake.

From "[The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living](https://smile.amazon.com/Art-Science-Low-Carbohydrate-Living/dp/0983490708?sa-no-redirect=1){:target="_blank"}"

> Low carb diets are natriuretic - they make the kidneys dump sodium. Sodium deficiency can cause headache, dizziness and fatigue. With continued low carb intake and sodium restriction, at some point your kidneys start to excrete potassium in order to conserve sodium. Potassium deficiency can lead to muscle cramps, cardiac dysrythmia. it can also cause the body to lose muscle, even when there's plenty of protein in the diet.

So the takeaway for these observations and research is you need to supplement the ketogenic diet with sodium, potassium, and other minerals. 

There is also a 2004 published article ["Long-term effects of a ketogenic diet in obese patients"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2716748/){:target="_blank"} from the US National Library of Medicine that states:

> The present study shows the beneficial effects of a long-term ketogenic diet. It significantly reduced the body weight and body mass index of the patients. Furthermore, it decreased the level of triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and blood glucose, and increased the level of HDL cholesterol. Administering a ketogenic diet for a relatively longer period of time did not produce any significant side effects in the patients. Therefore, the present study confirms that it is safe to use a ketogenic diet for a longer period of time than previously demonstrated.

##### TLDR;

In summary the ketogenic diet does have some medical backing in terms of its effectiveness and safety. However, I do know from a first hand account of someone that saw success on the keto diet the rebound is quite severe if you stop eating LCHF foods. If you are planning to do this diet it appears you need a great deal of discipline and are ready to acknowledge this diet requires a drastic lifestyle change. Regardless I think I will be ready to try this. Stay tuned for an upcoming experiment with [Keto Fuel](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/){:target="_blank"}

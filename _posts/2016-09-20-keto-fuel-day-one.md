### Keto Fuel Experiment

The purpose of these posts will be a daily log of how I feel with the Keto Fuel experiment. If you missed what I am doing please check out my previous post [here](https://taylorsmcclure.github.io//the-experiment/){:target="_blank"}

### Day One

I woke up with a splitting headache and hardly any energy. I was experiencing the telltale signs of [induction flu](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/side-effects#inductionflu){:target="_blank"}. I can attribute this completely to my body's inability to retain water, I am severely dehydrated. To combat this I am putting potassium chloride in a few of my drinks per day. In addition I am also putting normal fine grain salt into some drinks.

### Hunger Suppression 

Appetite level is very low. I dread the next time I have to drink a shake as I fear the taste will make my body reject what I am putting in its stomach. Towards the end of the day I was feeling a little hungry, so I prepared some black coffee. That stifled all hunger.

### Body Affects

My body was feeling terrible, constant headaches, shaking, and generally feeling like shit. I would get lightheaded from time to time, but forcing down some salt water cleared that up. I also realized that my body does not accept high levels of sodium that well. I noticed under my eyes would get puffy and my face would be semi-flushed to a rosy color.

### Morning Weigh-In

238 lbs, a stark difference from the previous day's 243. This is mostly all attributed to water loss. My body was extremely dehydrated.

### Moving Forward

I will be still be going on with the week long experiment, just 5 days to go. At this point I can pretty definitively say this complete meal replacement would not be sustainable for a casual dieter. Stay tuned for more updates!

### Blogging

Blogging consistently is hard... I honestly don't know how people keep it up. It's not just as simple as finding the time to do it, but having the motivation. I struggle with the latter. That coupled with not really wanting attention makes me wonder why I have a blog at all? I guess it is just for me to chronicle things and stay motivated on whatever projects I am involved with.

### Keto Diet

I have seen some pretty great differences with Keto. I am now down about 10lbs from my starting weight, so I can definitely count that as a success. My girlfriend and I have recently plateaued on the diet however... I can almost certainly attribute this to not keep strict with counting my calories. The one sure way to lose wait is to maintain a caloric deficit. I can tell my caloric intake is very close to my BMR. I need to start strictly counting calories with my app to stay on track.

### New Car

Hey I got a new car. Specifically a 2017 Subaru WRX. I had my eyes on this car ever since I came up to the Pacific Northwest. The power in the engine combined with the all wheel drive makes this beast breeze through rough forest roads in the Cascades. I am still trying to think of a name for her. I am looking for a heroine based in Japanese mythology which would appropriately suit her.

After driving an automatic for about four years it is interesting to get back into a manual transmission car. For the most part I just need to work on where my clutch catches and to not panic when starting off in first. I have been driving a lot more than normal and finding a lot of excuses to get behind the wheel. I have had the car for about two weeks now and already put on about 400 miles.

### Moving Forward

I have some potential big changes coming up in my life. I am still waiting to see if it will work out, which I am hoping it will. We will see.

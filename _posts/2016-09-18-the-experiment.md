## Keto Fuel Experiment

As alluded to previously in my [on the radar post](https://taylorsmcclure.github.io//on-the-radar/){:target="_blank"} I will be taking on a complete meal replacement for seven days and non-scientifically measure the impact it has on my body. For those of you that are curious about the ketogenic diet, check out my blog post that breaks it down [here](https://taylorsmcclure.github.io//ketogenic-diet/){:target="_blank"}.

At the start of the experiment I weigh in at approximately 243lbs, which a gracious amount of that being body fat and not muscle. For reference I am male, 5' and 11" tall.

### BMR and Keto Calorie Calculator

I used a fancy tool called the [Keto Calculator](http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/){:target="_blank"} which roughly determines your [Basal Metabolic Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate){:target="_blank"}(BMR), guides you on your macro nutrient needs (carbs, proteins, and, fats), and gives your a calorie per day goal.

Here are my results:

| Macro      | Grams(g) | Calories (kcal)  |
| ---------- |:--------:| ----------------:|
| Carbs      | 25       | 100              |
| Protein    | 137      | 548              |
| Fats       | 135      | 1213             |
|            |          |                  |
| Total kcal |          | *1861*           |

### Keto Fuel Meal Replacement

So I opted for Super Body Fuel's [Keto Fuel](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/){:target="_blank"} meal replacement. The San Francisco based team is a group of about 3 amateur scientists who's focus is to improve and build upon the [Soylent](https://www.soylent.com/){:target="_blank"} Open Sourced recipe. I was first introduced into Soylent and alternative food sources a few years ago from this [Vice documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8NCigh54jg){:target="_blank"}. It's a good watch if you are thinking about trying any alternative food out.

#### Ingredients

You can check out the full list of ingredients of Keto Fuel on their site, but the main ones that are the majority of this powder are:

* Organic Sprouted Brown Rice Protein
* L-Lysine Hydrochloride
* Psyllium Husk
* Sea Salt
* Potassium Citrate
* Calcium Citrate
* Magnesium Citrate
* and a whole lot of micro nutrients

At this point if you are a keen observer of the Keto diet staples you may notice something odd. There are no fats in this powder, and you are absolutely correct. This leads us to...

#### Keto Fuel Preparation

So Keto Fuel is not as simple as scooping powder into a bottle of water, shaking it up, and then drinking the meal replacement. You will need some extra ingredients to mix in. Those ingredients are:

* [MCT Powder](https://smile.amazon.com/Quest-Nutrition-MCT-Powder-Ounce/dp/B016APVE5S){:target="_blank"} or Oil
* Olive Oil or Heavy Cream

I opted for the Keto Fuel pre formulated plan of the following ratio for my macronutrients carbs:protien:fats 5:25:70 (in grams). To do this I will need to prepare 4 meals a day with the following preportions each:

| Ingredient | Amount   | Calories (kcal)  |
| ---------- |:--------:| ----------------:|
| Keto Fuel  | 1 scoop  | 140              |
| MCT Powder | 2 scoop  | 120              |
| Heavy Cream| 4 tbsp   | 200              |
| Water      | 1 1/2 cup| 0                |
|            |          |                  |
| Total kcal |          | 460              |
| All meals  |          | *1840*           |

So I am 21kcal short of my goal from the keto calculator, but this should be good.

### Stay Tuned

So over the week I will be trying to consistently blog each day with its ups and downs.

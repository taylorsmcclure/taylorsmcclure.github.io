### Keto Fuel Experiment

The purpose of these posts will be a daily log of how I feel with the Keto Fuel experiment. If you missed what I am doing please check out my previous post [here](https://taylorsmcclure.github.io//the-experiment/){:target="_blank"}

### Day Zero

So this is the first day. I was expecting it to actually be much more difficult than it really was. I do have to say I am accustomed to replacing meals with shakes, so I knew exactly what I was getting into. I drank all 4 meals throughout the day. I had a [bulletproof coffee](https://blog.bulletproof.com/how-to-make-your-coffee-bulletproof-and-your-morning-too/){:target="_blank"} in the morning for breakfast. Then waiting until about 1:45p to have my first shake. So let's move on to...

### Taste

The taste is actually horrendous. There is no sugar coating this (pun intended), absolutely chalky, over abundantly salty, and extremely viscous to slide down your throat hole. On the plus side it is actually effective of deterring me to eat anything due to its terrible taste.

### Hunger Suppression 

Appetite suppression is quite good. Even at a 20% caloric deficit I do not feel hungry with 4 meals a day. In the future if I do feel hungry I plan on having a cup of black coffee to suppress the urge.

### Body Affects

The first shake at 1:45p made me quite nauseous almost immediately. This was partially my fault as I downed it in about 2 minutes, the subsequent times I paced myself. My friend also keenly pointed out my recipe called for two scoops of MCT powder. He explained the affects of one scoop in his coffee in the morning on his digestive system, let's just say he needs to be close to the restroom.

### Moving Forward

I will be still be going on with the week long experiment, just 6 days to go. At this point I can pretty definitively say this complete meal replacement would not be sustainable for a casual dieter. Stay tuned for more updates!

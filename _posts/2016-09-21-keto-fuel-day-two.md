### Keto Fuel Experiment

The purpose of these posts will be a daily log of how I feel with the Keto Fuel experiment. If you missed what I am doing please check out my previous post [here](https://taylorsmcclure.github.io//the-experiment/){:target="_blank"}

### Day Two

48 hours and 8 keto fuel meals have now passed. I feel absolutely horrendous. I went to bed around 12:00a and woke up consistently through the night for unknown reasons. I managed to right myself out of bed at around 9:30a. I felt as if the previous day's terrible feelings were doubled. I could barely move, head splitting, nose/throat bone dry. Desperate need for hydration. At this point I realized putting my body/mind through this was not something I want to continue doing. Just thinking about the taste of the next shake had me nearly dry heaving.

### Body Affects

Sluggish, hard to move, splitting headache, and light headedness. 

### Morning Weigh-In

241 lbs. I gained back some water weight despite feeling so incredibly shitty.

### Moving Forward

I have decided to not continue the Keto Fuel shakes as my main source of calories. The amount of stress and shittiness my body was feeling was definitely not worth the potential fat loss. In the future when my palate is ready for the shake I can absolutely see this being an effective meal replacement for 1-2 meals a day. 

After deciding to stop the experiment. I immediately had 1 slice of bacon, 1 egg, and half of an avocado. My body almost instantly felt better. I had my energy back, my headache was gone, and I am ready to continue the day as I would normally. I will continue my Keto diet, but with whole foods rather than shakes. I have also modified [myfitnesspal](www.myfitnesspal.com){:target="_blank"} (a calorie counter) to track the necessary macros and nutrients for Keto. See this [post](http://cavemanketo.com/configuring-mfp/){:target="_blank"} on how you can set it up.

In the end for a casual dieter, I believe replacing every meal with Keto Fuel is not feasible based on the affects it has on your body. However, I can see this being an effective means of weight loss in a closely monitored medical environment. If I was bed ridden with a constant stream of drug cocktail in my IV, this would work wonders at reducing weight.
